Godot is an open source game engine that I have been following.
I have been focusing on React as of late, but might get back to Godot when I have the opportunity and version 4.0 is released with a Vulcan implementation.

A lot the projects are tutorials, but I've been working on My3dPlatformer as a personal project, and started learning a bit of blender for it.
