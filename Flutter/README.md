I'm very interested in Flutter and plan to keep an eye on it's development and see how it's adopted by the industry. I'm very impressed at how easy it makes it to develop cross-platform mobile apps on Linux, since you can run the same code with hot reloading on Linux without the need for resource intensive emulators or clunky USB debugging.

A lot of these are tutorials I followed for reference. My favorite app is SashaFanClubID, which is a little fan club member card I have on my phone which I made for the love of my life.
