# Code
Code I have written in several different languages.
The project I'm working the most on is called reader (temp name) under React. It will ultimately be a program similar to the app DuChinese, and will make it easier to read stories in another language and provide an easy interface to see translations of sentences/words and hear how words are pronounced.

Godot is an open source game engine I've been learning to develop a 3d game.
Godot uses its own scripting language called GDScript which closely resembles Python.

I am also interested in following new cutting-edge languages and technology and am also working a bit in Flutter+Dart.
