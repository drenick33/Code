# Code
Code I use to practice coding.
Godot is an open source game engine I've been learning to develop a 3d game.
Godot uses its own scripting language called GDScript which closely resembles Python.
I have recently decided to start learn how to develop cross platform mobile apps
I started by learning angular and nativescript but have recently switched to 
Flutter+Dart and find it a lot more intuitive and enjoy the coding style.
I'm decided to focus on Flutter and I will be frequently updating as I progress.
